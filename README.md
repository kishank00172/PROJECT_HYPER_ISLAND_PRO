# HYPER ISLAND PRO — Phase 0 Foundation

This is the first clean foundation build for **HYPER ISLAND PRO**.

## Locked decisions

- Language: **Kotlin**
- UI: **XML layouts**
- Assets: **XML drawables/vectors only**
- Min SDK: **API 33**
- Package: `com.hyperisland.pro`
- No fake punch-hole/cutout drawing. The island will be rendered as a flat AMOLED black surface in later phases.
- No fake feature toggles. If an engine is not implemented yet, UI clearly says it is coming later.

## What Phase 0 contains

- Clean Android project structure
- Main screen
- Permission Doctor screen
- Test Lab placeholder screen
- Settings screen with developer mode preference
- Placeholder service declarations for later phases:
  - Island overlay service
  - Notification listener service
  - Accessibility service
- GitHub Actions workflow to build debug APK

## What Phase 0 intentionally does NOT contain

- No floating island overlay yet
- No fake notification island
- No fake music/call/download/timer states
- No Firebase yet
- No Shizuku integration yet

## Build on GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload/push all files from this folder to the repository root.
3. Open the **Actions** tab.
4. Run **Android Debug APK** workflow manually, or push to `main`.
5. Download the generated APK artifact.

## Phase 0 phone test checklist

After installing the APK:

- App opens without crash
- Home screen shows `Phase 0 — Foundation`
- Permission Doctor opens
- Overlay permission Fix button opens correct settings
- Notification access Fix button opens correct settings
- Accessibility Fix button opens correct settings
- Battery optimization Fix button opens correct settings or fallback settings
- Test Lab clearly says real engines will come later
- Settings developer mode toggle saves state

## Next phase

**Phase 1 — Real AMOLED black pill overlay using WindowManager**

Phase 1 will add:

- Real overlay service
- Pure black pill `#000000`
- Top-center position
- Show/hide toggle
- Basic X/Y/width/height settings
- No fake cutout drawing
